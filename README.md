# Glimmr - A Women-Centered Dating App

---

## Summary

Glimmr is an attempt to address the gender gap on dating apps by putting women's user experience first, thereby creating a better experience for everyone. The cornerstones of its design philosophy are safety, honesty, and consent.

## Objectives

### Core Experience

- Separate channels/profiles for dating and hookups, with the latter focused on sexual compatibility and friends with benefits (not one-night stands)
- Platonic connections may have their own channel
- Ability to hide/deactivate profiles and/or delete account (with limited data retention for moderation)
- Standard features: viewing, swiping, matching, messaging
- Limit on daily views/likes to encourage meaningful engagement
- Robust filters: age, gender, height, sexuality, distance, race/ethnicity, monogamy vs. polyamory, children (have/want), education, religion/spirituality, political affiliation, last active date, etc.
- Selected categories displayed "above the fold," with the rest in an expandable section
- Minimum word count for bios
- Profiles inactive for over a month automatically hidden
- Simple algorithm based on past likes/matches (not AI matchmaking, can be turned off)

### Safety and Trust

- Universal background checks (non-violent crime not a disqualifier, just sexual or violent crime)
- AI verification of profile pictures
- AI pre-screening of pictures sent in chat, with consent required before displaying
- Post-date surveys for women to report concerns about safety, honesty, or consent
- Location sharing with trusted contacts during dates
- Safe, accessible, private reporting as well as unmatching and blocking
- Community Guidelines page outlining behavior expectations

### Support

- Resources page with articles on consent, boundaries, empathy, safety, profile tips, etc.
- Feedback page for user concerns and suggestions

### Business / Tech

- Subscription-based with a single membership tier and a one-month free trial
- Free for women
- Non-profit: emphasis on sustainability and user experience, not shareholder profit
- Progressive Web App (PWA) architecture for accessibility across devices

## Motivations

>There's way more men on dating apps than women. A quick Google search suggests a ratio between 60:40 for Hinge and OKCupid and 75:25 for Tinder and Bumble. Why do you think that is?
>
>The consensus among my female friends is that a) women have valid concerns about their safety and b) the volume of messages they get is literally overwhelming. On the face of it, this is a user experience problem, but I would argue that it's also a usability problem: no one's getting what they want out of these apps.
>
>I'm curious what a dating app designed for women would look like--because it's not Bumble.

Glimmr is the product of extensive research and testing. In addition to safety and the overwhelming amount of attention, issues like the mismatch between people looking for relationships and people looking for hookups, unicorn hunting, fetishization, dishonesty, the abundance of fake/inactive profiles, and the "freemium" business model most dating apps use also came up. The features outlined above attempt to address these issues.

It's important to note that the extreme gender imbalance on apps like Bumble and Tinder also hurts men. In focusing on women's priorities, this app hopes to address that imbalance--and all the issues that come with it.
